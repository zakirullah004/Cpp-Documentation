                <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.</p>
                <p>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
                <p>The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

                <h4>What is C ?</h4>
                <p>C is a structural or procedural programming language that was developed by Computer Scientist Dennis
                    Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories. C is a basic programming language that can be used to develop
                    an operating system such as Windows, Apple OS X to complex programs like Oracle Database, MySQL,
                    Adobe, Python interpreter, Git, etc. Being procedural language C does not support Objects or
                    Classes.</p>

                <h4>What is C++ ?</h4>
                <p>C++ was also known as “C with Classes,” which is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming
                    language. Bjarne Stroustrup developed this language in 1979. It is a multi-paradigm programming
                    language as it supports both procedural and object-oriented programming languages. C++ has the
                    property of the C programming language along with the classes and objects for user-defined data
                    types. C++ is used with graphics applications, operating systems, smartwatches, game development,
                    cloud distributed system, compilers, etc.</p>

                <p>The basic syntax of C++ is very simple. A statement is a unit of code terminated by a semicolon.</p>

                            #include <iostream> <br>
                                using namespace std; <br>
                                <br>
                                int main() { <br>
                                  cout << "Hello World!"; <br>

            <article>
                <p>Variables play a significant role in constructing a program, storing values in memory and dealing
                    with them. Variables are required in various functions of every program. Variables are used in
                    C++ where you will need to store any type of values within a program and whose value can be
                    changed during the program execution.</p>

                <ol>The general rules for naming variables are:
                    <li>Names can contain letters, digits and underscores</li>
                    <li>Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)</li>
                    <li>Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)</li>
                    <li>Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc</li>
                    <li>Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names
                    </li>

            <article>
                <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
                <p>C++ is a strongly-typed language, and requires every variable to be declared with its type before its
                    first use. This informs the compiler the size to reserve in memory for the variable and how to
                    interpret its value. The syntax to declare a new variable in C++ is straightforward: we simply write
                    the type followed by the variable name (i.e., its identifier). For example:</p>
                <p>If declaring more than one variable of the same type, they can all be declared in a single statement
                    by separating their identifiers with commas. For example:</p>
                <code>int a = 2, b, c;<br>
                            cout << a;                 
        
                        </code>

            <article>
                <p>This section will discuss the const keyword in the C++ programming language. It is the const keywords
                    used to define the constant value that cannot change during program execution. It means once we
                    declare a variable as the constant in a program, the variable's value will be fixed and never be
                    changed. If we try to change the value of the const type variable, it shows an error message in the
                    program.</p>
                <p>In C++, we can create variables whose value cannot be changed. For that, we use the const keyword.
                    Here's an example:</p>
                <code>
                            const int num = 25;<br>
                            cout << num;

                <p>In <strong class="inline">C++,</strong> there are different types of variables (defined with

                <p><strong>float</strong> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</p>
                <p><strong>string</strong> - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double
                    quotes</p>
                <p><strong>char</strong>- stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by
                    single quotes</p>
                <p><strong>bool</strong>- stores values with two states: true or false</p>

            <article>
                <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
                    You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
                    Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the
                    code once, and use it many times.</p>

                <h4>creating a function</h4>
                <p>C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. But you can
                    also create your own functions to perform certain actions.
                    To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by
                    parentheses ():</p>
                <code>
                                void myFunction() {<br>
                                    // code to be executed <br>
                                  }
                            </code>

                <h4>calling a function</h4>

                <p>Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed
                    later, when they are called.To call a function, write the function's name followed by two
                    parentheses () and a semicolon ;<br>
